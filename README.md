### A universal Anemone theme for all iOS devices supported by Anemone!

## Why is this theme named this way?

Icons for this theme have been created either by making new Icons using Microsoft Word, or by modifying stock icons to change just their gradients

## Are all new icons created completely in Word?

For the most part, yes. Some edits may be done using GIMP, but the base template for all icons was done using Microsoft Word

## Why Microsoft Word?

Well, it was originally a joke that icons better than Apple's own could be made using Microsoft Word. This theme is just a proof of concept

## So few icons?

The goal of this theme is to blend with stock icons, so the "good" stock icons should look themed even though they aren't

# Criteria for icon requests

Icon requests should only be made if the stock icon looks awful (e.g. stock Settings/Safari icons). If it looks fine either stock or with CircleIcons, we will not accept the request.

# Contributing

### Which word version is needed?

The theme was made using Word 2016, although Word 2010 or higher should work fine.

### Am I allowed to use GIMP?

Yes, but only to edit existing icons, either Apple's stock, or made from Microsoft Word

### Am I allowed to use Photoshop?

No, you must use either free software or Microsoft Word

### What files do I need to upload with my icon

For WordArt icons: You must upload the original docx file. If any post-processing is done, also upload the xcf file for GIMP
For ReverseGradient icons: You must upload the original stock icon and the xcf file for GIMP

### How do I make ReverseGradient icons?

In GIMP:

1. Duplicate layer
2. Select top layer
3. Invert Colors
4. Color to Alpha (Set color to #000000)
5. Invert Colors
6. Alpha to selection
7. Gradient Tool
